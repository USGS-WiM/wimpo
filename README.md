## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](../../tags).

Advance the version when adding features, fixing bugs or making minor enhancement. Follow semver principles. To add tag in git, type git tag v{major}.{minor}.{patch}. Example: git tag v2.0.5

To push tags to remote origin: `git push origin --tags`

When a new release (or version) occurs, change the Unreleased section of the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) into a new release version section and start a clean Unreleased section.

*Note that your alias for the remote origin may differ.
